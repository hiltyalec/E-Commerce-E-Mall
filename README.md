Challenge 13: E-Commerce Back End

E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

The challenge was to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Which will take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
